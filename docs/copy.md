Software engineering for me is a craft, one honed through years of practice in the pursuit of excellence. I've been lucky enough to have had a varied career that has seen me being part of some amazing projects, from building pioneering mental health chatbots, to ruggedised satellite communication fly-away cases, IoT gateways, full-stack web apps, as well as data visualisation and Mixed Reality solutions.
